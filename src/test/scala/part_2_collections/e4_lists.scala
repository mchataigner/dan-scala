/**
*   Let's move on to lists...
*
*   Starting point of scala collections is trait Iterable.
*   Higher order function (map, filter, foreach...) that we will see next
*   can be used on classes of Collection API.
*   Collections are immutable by default, however it is possible to use their mutable form.
*
*   Actually Scala promote to use immutability (Scala has been designed in care of thread safety)
*
*   A List containing elements x1,...,xn is printed List(x1, ..., xn).
*
*   List class consists of a composition of two case classes: `Nil` (empty list) and `::` (cons)
*   x::xs represent a list with the element x followed by the list xs
*   List is a recursive structure and element types must be the same in the whole list.
*
*   Lists have useful functions: isEmpty, filter, head, tail...
*
*   This can help: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.List
